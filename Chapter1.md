## Bitcore – A Genuinely Community-Driven Payment Solution
Bitcore is a cryptocurrency designed to make the original Bitcoin vision future-proof.

Bitcore maintains Bitcoin’s central advantages – but the Bitcore founding team is taking the original Bitcoin technology boldly into the future. Bitcore, originally a hybrid fork of Bitcoin, features a proof-of-work consensus mechanism and implements all of the BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) of the Bitcoin protocol.

Through its lean structure and active community, Bitcore is more agile than other coins in implementing necessary innovations. On the Bitcore blockchain, SegWit (Segregated Witness) was activated a full 4.5 months earlier than on the Bitcoin blockchain, making it fully compatible to the Lightning Network.

Most importantly, Bitcore implements true decentralization and user empowerment:
* Bitcore‘s ASIC-resistant mining algorithm restores community participation and counters centralization effects in mining.
* Bitcore’s application of Bloom filters (i) significantly reduces the required storage to run a full blockchain node, enabling more individual users to become fully empowered Bitcore participants via SPV/light wallets.
* Bitcore’s novel airdrop process resulted in a decidedly more equal distribution of the coins, encouraging Bitcore’s use as a means of payment. The Bitcore community‘s decision to forgo an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) has kept speculators at bay.
* Bitcore is faster than Bitcoin, faster than even Paypal, enabling it to become a real everyday payment option, thanks to its timely implementation of SegWit and other design decisions. On the Lightning Network, a theoretically unlimited number of offline transactions are supported.
Bitcore’s low fees of around $0.003 USD per transaction make it even more suitable for everyday use and render micropayments feasible.
* Bitcore is an open source project: Collaboratively produced, shared freely, published transparently, and developed to be a community good rather than the property or business of a single company or person (ii).

**In a nutshell:**

Bitcore is the original community-driven, peer-to-peer digital payment solution, adapted to the needs of tomorrow. If Satoshi Nakamoto had known in 2008 what experience has taught the crypto community in the past 10 years, Bitcore is what Bitcoin (iv) had looked like from the very start. Today, Bitcore offers everyone the opportunity to be a part of Satoshi’s original vision, fresh and unstained by questionable economic developments of the past.
