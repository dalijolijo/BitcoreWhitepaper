## Community and Roadmap

### 4.1 Community
Bitcore offers a wide range of technological advantages, such as speedy transactions and low transaction costs, that make it particularly suitable to everyday applications. However, Bitcore does not only live through its technology: A considerable strength and advantage of Bitcore is its diverse and multi-faceted community.

From its very beginning, Bitcore has focused on fostering an active community unrestricted by geographical borders. This was reflected, among other things, in Bitcore‘s decision to forgo an ICO in favor of a more decentralized and equal-opportunity distribution mode (see section 2.2) – a decision based on community voting.

Not only are location and nationality irrelevant in the context of Bitcore community membership, but language should be as well. This is why Bitcore has been present in many social media channels in many different countries and languages right from the beginning.

There are many active sub-communities in a variety of languages. Especially noteworthy are the development and prominence of the Turkish- and Spanish-speaking communities within Bitcore. One of the goals of Bitcore is to strengthen such regional initiatives, which contribute massively to the overall strength of Bitcore.

## 4.2 Roadmap
Bitcore, as detailed above, is an exclusively community-driven project.

There is no central authority or executive committee responsible for certain milestones designed to satisfy shareholders or institutional investors.

Instead, Bitcore’s development is led by the needs and visions of its community members. The history of Bitcore has shown that this mode of operation and strategy-finding is conducive to innovation and the speedy implementation of necessary improvements.

Even though there is no centrally defined Roadmap for the coming years, the Bitcore development team is of course constantly working to implement new features, as required by the community. Currently planned and active projects can be viewed on Bitcore’s website, https://bitcore.cc/roadmap/.
